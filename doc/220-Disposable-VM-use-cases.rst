From Adrelanos https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1118#issuecomment-131395780
where View-in-DispVM behaviour was created.

So we have 4 use cases here.

* "View in Disposable VM with disabled networking"
* "View in Disposable VM with enabled networking"
* "Edit in Disposable VM with disabled networking"
* "Edit in Disposable VM with enabled networking"
